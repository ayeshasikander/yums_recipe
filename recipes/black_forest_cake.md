# 🍒 Black Forest Cake  

## Ingredients  

### For the Cake  
- 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour  
- ¾ cup cocoa powder  
- 1 ½ tsp baking powder  
- 1 ½ tsp baking soda  
- ½ tsp salt  
- 2 large eggs  
- 1 cup granulated sugar  
- ½ cup vegetable oil  
- 1 cup buttermilk  
- ½ cup hot water  

### For the Filling & Topping  
- 1 can cherry pie filling  
- 2 cups heavy cream  
- ½ cup powdered sugar  
- Chocolate shavings  

## Instructions  

1. **Preheat oven:** Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease two 9-inch round cake pans.  
2. **Make the cake batter:**  
   - In a large bowl, combine all-purpose flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  
   - In another bowl, whisk together eggs, sugar, vegetable oil, buttermilk, and hot water until smooth. Gradually mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until fully incorporated.  
3. **Bake:** Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool the cakes completely before assembling.  
4. **Whip the cream:** Using a mixer, beat heavy cream and powdered sugar together until stiff peaks form.  
5. **Assemble the cake:** Place one cake layer on a serving plate. Spread a layer of cherry pie filling over the top, followed by a generous layer of whipped cream. Place the second cake layer on top and repeat. Frost the outside of the cake with whipped cream.  
6. **Decorate:** Garnish the cake with chocolate shavings and additional cherries, if desired.
