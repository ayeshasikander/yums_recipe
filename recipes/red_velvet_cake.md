## Instructions  

1. **Preheat oven** to 350°F (175°C) and grease two 9-inch round cake pans.  
2. **Prepare the cake batter:** In a bowl, combine the dry ingredients: flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. In another bowl, beat the butter and sugar until fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.  
3. **Add wet ingredients:** Mix in the buttermilk, vanilla extract, white vinegar, and red food coloring. Gradually add the dry ingredients and mix until just combined.  
4. **Bake the cake:** Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans and bake for 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool completely.  
5. **Prepare the frosting:** Beat the cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract until smooth and creamy.  
6. **Frost the cake:** Once the cakes are completely cool, frost with the cream cheese frosting.
