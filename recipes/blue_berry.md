## 🥣 Instructions  

1. **Prepare the Blueberries**  
   - In a saucepan, combine blueberries and ½ cup of sugar.  
   - Cook over medium heat until the blueberries break down and form a sauce (~10 minutes).  
   - Strain the sauce to remove seeds and let it cool completely.  

2. **Make the Base**  
   - In a large bowl, mix heavy cream, milk, the remaining sugar, vanilla extract, and lemon juice (if using).  
   - Stir until sugar is dissolved.  

3. **Combine**  
   - Add the cooled blueberry sauce to the cream mixture.  
   - Mix well until fully incorporated.  

4. **Churn or Freeze**  
   - **With an Ice Cream Maker**: Pour the mixture into your ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  
   - **Without an Ice Cream Maker**: Pour the mixture into a shallow dish, freeze for 1 hour, then stir. Repeat every 30 minutes until fully frozen and creamy (~3-4 hours).  

5. **Serve**  
   - Scoop, serve, and enjoy! Add toppings like fresh blueberries, whipped cream, or a drizzle of blueberry sauce for extra flair.
