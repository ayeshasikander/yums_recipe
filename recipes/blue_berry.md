# Blueberry Ice Cream Recipe

## Ingredients

### For the Blueberry Sauce
- 2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries
- ¬Ω cup granulated sugar

### For the Ice Cream Base
- 2 cups heavy cream
- 1 cup whole milk
- ¬Ω cup granulated sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 tbsp lemon juice (optional, for added tanginess)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Blueberry Sauce:**
   - In a medium saucepan, combine blueberries and ¬Ω cup of sugar.
   - Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the blueberries break down and form a thick sauce (about 10 minutes).
   - Strain the sauce through a fine mesh sieve to remove seeds and skins, then let it cool completely.

2. **Prepare the Ice Cream Base:**
   - In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the heavy cream, milk, remaining ¬Ω cup of sugar, vanilla extract, and lemon juice (if using) until the sugar is fully dissolved.

3. **Combine the Mixtures:**
   - Stir the cooled blueberry sauce into the cream mixture until fully incorporated.

4. **Freeze the Ice Cream:**
   - **With an Ice Cream Maker:** Pour the mixture into your ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. Transfer to an airtight container and freeze for 2-4 hours to firm up.
   - **Without an Ice Cream Maker:** Pour the mixture into a shallow dish and place it in the freezer. After 1 hour, stir the mixture with a fork to break up ice crystals. Repeat this process every 30 minutes for 3-4 hours, or until the ice cream is creamy and fully frozen.

5. **Serve:**
   - Scoop into bowls or cones, and serve with your favorite toppings such as fresh blueberries, whipped cream, or a drizzle of blueberry sauce.

## Notes

- **Storage:** Store in an airtight container in the freezer for up to 2 weeks.
- **Serving Tip:** Let the ice cream sit at room temperature for 5 minutes before scooping for a smoother texture.
- **Customizations:** Add mix-ins like chocolate chips, nuts, or cookie crumbles for extra flavor and texture.
- **Dairy-Free Option:** Substitute the cream and milk with coconut milk or almond milk for a dairy-free version.
